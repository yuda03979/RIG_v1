The equipment involved will include a single-seat contraption with its paddles primarily used for braking. It's going to be a bit of a swim, so we've included a swimming system with a rating of one. The surfboard material of choice here is plastic. As for the wheel function, it's currently not specified.","{'ruleInstanceName': 'Military Training Protocol', 'severity': 4, 'Seats': 1, 'Paddles function': 'braking', 'Surfboard material': 'plastic', 'Swimming system': 1, 'Wheel function': ''}",Kayak
