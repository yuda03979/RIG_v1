How is that feasible? How is it that such a significant move has such a low severity rating? And the threat level is just High? That's quite serious, but only High? Are they really terming it as just 'defection threat Critical Situation'? That doesn't make any sense at all. I thought defection of such a high profile operative would be much worse than this. The severity rating is just... a three? Are you certain about this? This doesn't seem to reconcile at all. How can an event of this magnitude be so low on the scale? It seems like they're trivializing the whole situation. 'defection threat Critical Situation' doesn't even seem to align with the situation at hand. Why is it being minimized this much?

The threat level is labeled as 'High', and yet the severity is just three? This doesn't make any sense! Why is it only a three when everything about this screams that it should be a five at least? The potential ally is an 'Opposition Group'? That's major! This is no minor defection, it's a full-blown threat to national security!

I can't comprehend this! This is a critical defection situation! How is that just a three, I mean, seriously, how can they rate something this dire as a three? I’m completely shocked by this. The levels don't line up. How is an intelligence operative defecting for personal gain considered just a level three? This sounds like it should be at least a level five. ‘Defection Threat Critical Situation’? That name is way too mild. This is a crisis, not some minor threat. Why are they downplaying it so much?

It's also said that there's a potential alliance with the 'Opposition Group'. But let me ask you—does this all add up? Is the severity rating justified, or should it be higher given the high threat level? Could the reason for defection be something other than personal gain?

You'd think they'd be handling something less risky, like intelligence gathering, but no, it's sabotage. The risk factor of the operation? It's as high as it can get, a solid five.

A whopping five, because subtlety has never been our forte, right? Loyalty level? Low, as usual. Nothing new under the sun. We're officially designating it as 'Covert Agent High Risk'.
